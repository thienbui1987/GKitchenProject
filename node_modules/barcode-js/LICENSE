ACCUSOFT CORPORATION
TOOLKIT SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT WHICH GOVERNS YOUR RIGHT TO USE OF THE TOOLKIT.  YOU MUST ACCEPT THESE TERMS BEFORE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO INSTALL THE TOOLKIT.  YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO CONTRACTUALLY BIND THE ORGANIZATION AGREEING TO THESE TERMS.
BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," OR INSTALLING TOOLKIT, OR PLACING TOOLKIT IN-USE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT.

1.  GRANT OF LICENSE
a) Evaluation License:  This Accusoft Corporation ("ACCUSOFT") Software License Agreement ("AGREEMENT")   grants the individual or organization contracting under this agreement ("LICENSEE")  a limited, nontransferable,  nonexclusive, and non-assignable license to use the trial mode version of this ACCUSOFT Development Toolkit ("TOOLKIT") on a single computer for evaluation of fitness only and not for any commercial purpose; or to use a  properly purchased and registered TOOLKIT for development purposes only on a single computer, provided the TOOLKIT is IN-USE on only one computer at any time.  (However, additional TOOLKIT licenses may be purchased.)  TOOLKIT is "IN-USE" on a computer when it becomes loaded by any means for any purpose into temporary memory (that is, including but not limited to RAM) or when it becomes copied or installed to less temporary storage by any means for any purpose (that is, including but not limited to hard disk, CD-ROM or other removable disk or tape, USB or other flash memory drive or card, or other local, networked, or cloud storage or device) when it is accessible to that computer.  The TOOLKIT is explicitly not to be used on a site-wide or on a public or private network basis, via a server or other networked connection.
b) Commercial License:  If any of your requirements aren't met by the 1.a. Evaluation License then you need a Commercial License.  A Commercial License for a commercial purpose may be acquired by contacting info@accusoft.com.  If a separate extended license agreement for TOOLKIT is entered into between Accusoft and LICENSEE at that time, then the terms of that agreement and the Term of that agreement shall govern only where different from the terms and Term of this Agreement.  If a separate Accusoft license agreement for TOOLKIT is not entered into at that time, then LICENSEE's permitted use of Program is governed by this Paragraph 1.b., in addition to Paragraph 1.a. Evaluation License, and all other terms and Term are according to this Agreement.  In that case, if the Commercial License is an annual license, then the Term of the license grant is for one year beginning on the date of purchase of Program and as may subsequently be extended by Accusoft on LICENSEE's request.  If the Commercial License is not an annual license, then the Term of the license grant is until terminated according to this Agreement.  In either case, Accusoft grants to LICENSEE a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to install TOOLKIT on a single computer and to use TOOLKIT for a commercial purpose provided the TOOLKIT is IN-USE on only one computer at any time and provided the TOOLKIT is not used on a site-wide basis, or on a public or private network basis, via a server or other networked connection.  If a Commercial License is a deployment license for the redistributable runtime portion of TOOLKIT ("PORTION"), then you may reproduce, display, or otherwise distribute and transfer, only as an integral part of a LICENSEE product, the number of RUNTIMES for which a deployment license was provided.

2.  EVALUATION LICENSE TELEMETRY DISCLAIMER
By using the TOOLKIT with an Evaluation License, you hereby agree to allow ACCUSOFT to collect and monitor data about which of the TOOLKIT API calls you use and which of our sample programs you use. We use this tracking information to determine which areas of the TOOLKIT are most (and least) popular to improve our SDK capabilities and our samples in the future. The tracking information is anonymized in such a way that neither ACCUSOFT nor anybody else can associate this information with you. Please note that no usage data is collected for a licensed TOOLKIT.

3.  REDISTRIBUTION OF TOOLKIT RUNTIMES
ACCUSOFT does not grant LICENSEE any rights to deploy, license, sell, reproduce, copy, install, lease, timeshare, rent, or otherwise distribute or transfer TOOLKIT or any PORTION of TOOLKIT except as provided in Section 1. GRANT OF AGREEMENT.  For licensing information about any other distribution of TOOLKIT or PORTION, please visit our web site (https://www.accusoft.com/licensing.htm), or contact our sales staff.  LICENSEE agrees to notify ACCUSOFT immediately of any violations or changes in status regarding LICENSEE's compliance with any term of this AGREEMENT.
In the event that ACCUSOFT grants LICENSEE in a written, separate runtime license agreement ("RUNTIME AGREEMENT") a right to deploy, license, sell, reproduce, copy, install, lease, timeshare, rent,  or otherwise distribute or transfer PORTIONS, the RUNTIME AGREEMENT will specify what PORTIONS may be distributed ("RUNTIME").  LICENSEE agrees to acknowledge and uphold the terms and conditions of this AGREEMENT as well as the terms of the RUNTIME AGREEMENT itself, which will be provided only in writing.  In such event, LICENSEE may distribute RUNTIMES as part of the LICENSEE's software application or derivative works ("PRODUCT") upon additionally agreeing to the following:
a) LICENSEE understands and acknowledges that in order to receive any discounted pricing for RUNTIME distribution licensing fees based on the type of installation, it must either: 1) prepay for a number of RUNTIME licenses that is sufficient to qualify for ACCUSOFT's then-current published quantity discount, or 2) it must pay for the licenses in accordance with a written contract between LICENSEE and ACCUSOFT.
b) LICENSEE's PRODUCT shall not compete to any degree with the TOOLKIT.  Such competitive PRODUCTS are defined as software development toolkits that include similar functionality as TOOLKIT and that are intended for use by software developers and/or system integrators.
c) LICENSEE's PRODUCT must be substantially greater in scope with greater functionality and features than those of the TOOLKIT.
d) LICENSEE will not use ACCUSOFT's name, logo, or trademarks to market PRODUCT without prior written approval of ACCUSOFT except LICENSEE will include a statement substantially similar to the following within PRODUCT documentation and about box: "Portions of this product contain imaging and other technology owned by Accusoft Corporation, Tampa, FL, (www.accusoft.com). ALL RIGHTS RESERVED."  See Section 21. THIRD PARTY NOTICES for additional requirements.
e) LICENSEE agrees to only distribute the RUNTIMES.  No license or other rights are granted to LICENSEE for any distribution of the TOOLKIT or PORTIONS including, but not limited to, documentation, source code, or the RUNTIME distribution unlock codes.
g) LICENSEE will only distribute the RUNTIMES on the hardware and operating system(s) for which the RUNTIMES are intended to be used according to the RUNTIME AGREEMENT.
If ANY of the terms of this AGREEMENT are not applicable to LICENSEE'S situation, or if any of the terms of this AGREEMENT cannot be complied with, or if LICENSEE needs modifications to this AGREEMENT or the license granted for any reason, LICENSEE must contact ACCUSOFT about obtaining an expanded license from ACCUSOFT (available by phone at: 813-875-7575, by e-mail at: info@accusoft.com or by fax at: 813-875-7705).
This AGREEMENT grants rights to LICENSEE only for the TOOLKIT and does not convey any other rights of any kind including, but not limited to, use or distribution of ACCUSOFT technology.

LICENSEE waives its right to contest any of ACCUSOFT's patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in and to the TOOLKIT.
LICENSEE shall not use such trademarks, service marks, and trade names except where and as permitted under this AGREEMENT without receiving ACCUSOFT's prior written approval of such use.

LICENSEE agrees that any violation or threat of violation of this AGREEMENT will result in irreparable harm to ACCUSOFT for which damages would be an inadequate remedy.

The foregoing sentence shall be applicable unless LICENSEE has negotiated and entered into a written, signed agreement with ACCUSOFT for such reduced or discounted licensing fees or royalties and paid ACCUSOFT such fees or royalties in advance of any of: (a) distribution of the TOOLKIT or PORTION, (b) copying of the TOOLKIT or PORTION, or (c) incorporation or use of the TOOLKIT or PORTION in or pertaining to any PRODUCT or service of LICENSEE.  Further, LICENSEE agrees that it shall not be entitled to reduced licensing fees or royalties when determining ACCUSOFT's damages due to any undertaking or activity by LICENSEE regarding the TOOLKIT or PORTION outside of or exceeding the scope of permission or other terms of this AGREEMENT, or LICENSEE's actions otherwise in violation of this AGREEMENT. 

14.  ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS

16.  SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this AGREEMENT is determined to be invalid by any court of final jurisdiction, then it shall be omitted and the remainder of the AGREEMENT shall continue to be binding and enforceable. In addition, the Court is hereby authorized to enforce any provision of the AGREEMENT that the Court otherwise deems unenforceable, to whatever lesser extent the Court deems reasonable and appropriate, rather than invalidating the entire provision. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, LICENSEE expressly agrees that should LICENSEE be found to have breached the AGREEMENT, under no circumstances shall LICENSEE be entitled to any volume or other discount, or reduced licensing fee or royalty in the determination of ACCUSOFT's damages, or otherwise in the determination of  any licensing fee or royalty owed to ACCUSOFT.
