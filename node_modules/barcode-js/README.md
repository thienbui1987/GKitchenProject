# What is Barcode Xpress

Barcode Xpress for Node.js enables developers to add the ability to read common industry 1D and 2D barcodes in their applications.

- **Barcode Types** - recognize over 30 different [types of barcodes](https://help.accusoft.com/BarcodeXpress/latest/BxNodeJs/webframe.html#supported-barcode-types.html). 
- **Structured Results** - results are organized in a hierarchical model where every barcode has a value, type, confidence, and location.
- **Simple** - by providing only a minimal asynchronous API, Barcode Xpress is easy to learn. With a few lines of code, recognize barcodes found in images produced by scanners, cameras, or fax machines.

## Getting Started

 1. Make sure you have the following system requirements:
    - Windows x64 operating systems of the following versions:
        - Windows 8.1
        - Windows 10
        - Windows Server 2012 (and R2)
        - Windows Server 2016
        - Windows Server 2019
    -  Linux x64 operating systems of the following versions:
        - Ubuntu 18.04
        - Ubuntu 20.04
        - CentOS 7
        - CentOS 8
        - Debian 9
        - Debian 10
    - Node.js versions 12, 14, 16 and npm (to check the version use the following command: `node -v`)
 2. Clone and run the [Hello Barcode Xpress for Node.js Sample](https://github.com/Accusoft/hello-barcode-xpress-for-nodejs)

Although Barcode Xpress for Node.js may run, it is not supported on earlier operating system versions (for example, Ubuntu 14.04 or Windows 7).

## Reading Barcodes

```js
// Import packages.
const bx = require("barcode-js");

// Set up logging function.
const logResults = (results) => console.log(JSON.stringify(results, ["type", "value", "confidence"], 2));

// Set up analysis function.
const analyzeBarcodes = async (filePath) => {
    try {
        const results = await bx.analyze(filePath);
        logResults(results);
    }
    catch(err) {
        console.error(`Fatal: Error analyzing image input\n${err}`);
    }
};

// Set up parameters.
// Accepted file types are bmp, tiff, jpg, gif, png, and url
const filePath = "test.bmp";

// Call analyze.
analyzeBarcodes(filePath);
```

## Accessing Results

The analyze method returns an array of result *objects*.

Each result object has the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": barcodeType,
    "value": barcodeValue,
    "area": {
        "x": xCoordinateBarcodeStart,
        "y": yCoordinateBarcodeStart,
        "height": barcodeHeight,
        "width": barcodeWidth
    },
    "corners": [
    {
        "x": xCoordinateTopLeft,
        "y": yCoordinateTopLeft
    },
    {
        "x": xCoordinateTopRight,
        "y": yCoordinateTopRight
    },
        {
        "x": xCoordinateBottomRight,
        "y": yCoordinateBottomRight
    },
        {
        "x": xCoordinateBottomLeft,
        "y": yCoordinateBottomLeft
    }
    ],
    "confidence": recognitionConfidence
}
```

For example, to get the confidence of a recognized barcode:

```js
const barcodeValue = result.confidence;
```

or to get the height property of a recognized barcode:

```js
const barcodeHeight = result.area.height;
```
